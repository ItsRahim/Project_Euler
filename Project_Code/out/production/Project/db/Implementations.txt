In dbConnector I need to:
-Check if it is a customer logging in or a staff
-If its a staff only the office manager can create, update delete staff. They can also add people on discounts
    Receptionist can only create new jobs for customers. If not available then shift or office manager can take over
-If its a new customer they must register with the system. All data is stored on the database
-If its a previous customer then it will check if the customer is valued before doing anything else
-When customer requests jobs to do the system will retrieve information about the tasks such as time and price
-Customers can pick what jobs they want via the jobID which makes it easier to access all information about it
-System will then assign the tasks to a job and store information about it on a db
-It will output price, time to complete and create an invoice for the customer
-Once jobs are complete it will update properly according to the system

-Make sure all inputs are validated when customers are answering
-Encrypt username and password for staff login
-When checking if customer exists it will take their surname and postcode to find the account
    Two people can have the same first name but not address. This is the best way to locate them
